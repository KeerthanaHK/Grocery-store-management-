Official Grocery Management System –
This project is my work on a grocery store management system which was created with PHP and MYSQL, using XAMPP AND PHPMYADMIN.

Getting Started

1.	Download this file which may be saved in the downloads folder in your documents or directory and unzip to extract the files from my website folder containing all the PHP, CSS code files, and report.  

2.	Launch WinZip from your start menu or Desktop shortcut. Open the compressed file by clicking File > Open. If your system has the compressed file extension associated with WinZip program, just double-click on the file.

3.	Select all the files and folders inside the compressed file. Or multi-select only the files or folders you want to open by holding the CTRL key and left-clicking on them.

4.	Click 1-click Unzip and choose Unzip to PC in the WinZip toolbar under the Unzip/Share tab.

5.	Choose the destination folder to place the extracting files and click unzip button.

6.	Find your extracted files in the destination folder.

7.	Install Xampp and run Apache and Sql. 

8.	Copy the CLERK folder to htdocs in the Xammp folder. 

9.	Load the grocery_stores.sql database (this can be found in the ‘SQL Folder’) to PHPMYADMIN using import in PHPMYADMIN in local server. 

10.	 To view the web application, type in ‘localhost:8080/clerk/login.php. 

11.	This will direct you to the login page. The login details are username: dumgaizuzu@gmail.com and password: Salva

12.	Once you’ve logged in, you will be directed to the homepage, which has the options for inserting, editing and updating data. 

13.	When you insert info into any of the tables, you would be redirected to the display table which has all the information and also allows you to edit or delete data.
